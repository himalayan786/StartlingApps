			<p style="color:#660000;">Dear All,<br><br>

In a very short span of time University institute of information technology has emerged as a fore runner in the area of imparting technical education in this hilly region. This brainchild of the university has long grown out of its infancy and is a symbol and functional token of the university’s commitment towards providing quality education in upcoming fields apart from the conventional courses that the university has been offering.
In the emerging world order India occupies a prominent place. UIIT has adopted a vision that is required to take our country further in the field of IT. UIIT in its own way has been successful in being a part of human resource development by contributing educated, skilled and highly qualified technical manpower.<br>
According to the knowledge commission’s current report, the focus is now towards self-employment i.e. towards entrepreneurship. IT as a tool helps people achieve the dream of self sustenance thereby leading people to lead affluent lives through their own employment. IT has moved from being just a tool and technology and now encompasses all that is required to connect. It now serves as a tool to bind people and connect them at all levels thereby also fulfilling the social requirements that the society demands nowadays.<br>
This tool can also help not only the blessed but also those poor people who are not so fortunate. Those who strive to put food into their plates at the end of the day. This revolution is benefiting all regardless of their social standing. Use of this tool is enabling the use of transparency in the current system of the country thereby making people responsible and helping them identify themselves with the needs of the common man.
With the advent of ICT this tool is helping specifically in the education sector thereby helping the young and restless transform into the able and efficient.<br>
We have a team of dedicated and skilled teachers who help our students in meeting the challenges of modern time.
I exhort you all to make concerted efforts to take UIIT further in the road towards technical excellence, which is the vision which the founders of the institute had in mind.<br>
I wish UIIT all the best for their future endeavors and as a patron I always stand by them for any support.<br>
For recruiters, I on behalf of UIIT Shimla, looking forward to welcome you in Shimla.<br><br>
